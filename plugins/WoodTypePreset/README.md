Wooden tools are not craftable, to allow choice of whether custom wooden tools or vanilla wooden tools will use the wood type.

Fences are able to connect to blocks with certain tags!
* To make your block connect to stairs on any side, use "tag:fence-connectable".
* To make it connectable from a certain side, use "tag:fence-connectable-east", "tag:fence-connectable-north", "tag:fence-connectable-south", and "tag:fence-connectable-west", with the cardinal direction being the side it will connect to.
